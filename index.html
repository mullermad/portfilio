    <div class="headings" id="headings">About me</div>
<div class="text"> My name is Muluken Demis, and I am a student at BIT Bahirdar University
    studying software engineering.
    Ever since I first started coding, 
    I have been fascinated by the creative potential of 
     technology and the way it can be used to solve complex problems.
    One of the things I love most about coding 
    is the challenge of solving difficult problems.
    I enjoy the process of breaking down a problem into smaller pieces,
    experimenting with different approaches, and eventually arriving at a solution that works. 
    I find that the feeling of satisfaction that comes from solving a tricky coding challenge is hard to beat.
    My dream is to become a software developer at a higher level. 
    I am excited about the prospect of working on larger and more complex 
    projects that have a real impact on people's lives. Whether it's developing a new software application,
    designing a website, or creating a new tool to automate a process, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
    In addition to my passion for coding, I also enjoy learning about new
    technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.
    I am constantly reading blogs, and participating in coding communities to stay connected with other developers and expand my knowledge.

    <div  class="headings"  id="headings">Education-background</div>
<div class="text">Education has always been a top priority for me, and I am proud to have pursued my academic career with diligence and dedication.
     I began my formal education at Shahura Primary School, where I developed a strong foundation in the core subjects of math, science,
     and language. My time at Shahura Primary School helped instill 
     in me a love of learning and a curiosity about the world around me that has stayed with me to this day.

    After completing my primary education, I enrolled at Shahura Secondary School, 
    where I continued to excel academically and pursued a rigorous course of study in the sciences.
    During this time, I developed an interest in technology.
    Following my secondary education, I enrolled at Shahura Preparatory School,
    where I further honed my skills and continued to explore 
    my passion for technology and software development.
    It was during this time that I decided to pursue a career in software engineering, 
    and I set my sights on studying at a leading university in this field.


    In 2012 E.C, I began my studies in software engineering at Bahirdar University,
    where I have been able to deepen my knowledge and skills in this exciting field.
    I have taken courses in a wide range of topics till now on this feild of study.
    I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to pursue my education and explore 
    my interests in software engineering, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field.
    I am confident that the skills and knowledge I have gained will serve me well as I pursue my dream of 
    becoming a software developer at a higher level.</div>
